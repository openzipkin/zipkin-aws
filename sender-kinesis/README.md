# sender-kinesis

This component leverages [zipkin-reporter-java](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java)
interfaces to send spans to Amazon Kinesis for collection and processing. Kinesis is an alternative
to kafka that is fully managed in the AWS cloud.

Spans are put on the queue as a Thrift encoded blob. The associated collector expects this and will
decode appropriately.

## Configuration

A minimal configuration of this sender would be:

```java
sender = KinesisSender.builder().streamName("my-stream").build();
```

Additionally the `CredentialsProvider`, `EndpointConfiguration`, and `region` can all be customized as
needed.

```java
sender = KinesisSender.builder()
    .streamName("my-stream")
    .region("us-west-1")
    .credentialsProvider(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(new AnonymousAWSCredentials()))
    .endpointConfiguration(new AwsClientBuilder.EndpointConfiguration("http://localhost:8080/", "us-east-1"))
    .build();
```

## Requirements

The credentials that your service has requires the following permissions in order to function:

`kinesis:DescribeStream` for health checking

`kinesis:PutRecord` for placing spans on the queue

[collector-kinesis](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws/tree/master/collector-kinesis) is available
to allow your zipkin server to pull traces off of a kinesis queue in the place of the built in http,
thrift, and kafka.

[sparkstreaming-stream-kinesis](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws/tree/master/sparkstreaming-stream-kinesis)
is a module for the [zipkin-sparkstreaming](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-sparkstreaming)
project that allows to reading the spans and running real-time spark processing on them.
